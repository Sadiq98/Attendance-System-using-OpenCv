# Attendance-System-using-OpenCv
The main purpose of this project is to build a face recognition-based attendance monitoring system for educational institution to enhance and upgrade the current attendance system into more efficient and effective as compared to before. The manual entering of attendance in logbooks becomes difficult and takes a lot of time also, so we have designed an efficient module that comprises of face recognition using LBPH algorithm(OpenCV) to manage the attendance records of employee or students. During enrolling of a user, we take multiple images of a user along with his/her id/roll number and name. The presence of each student/employee will be updated in Excel Sheet. This process can give us more accurate results in user interactive manner rather than the existing attendance systems. This also gives students/employees a more accurate result in user interactive manner rather than existing attendance management system.
